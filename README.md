When you click on sign you will be taken to a sign up process that asks whether the account being signed up is a studen, parent, or teacher and when finished will be sent back to the log in screen. Once logged in you will be taken to the dashboard which has 6 other different sections of the app. The features include a home dashboard which includes a link to the West-MEC Instagram, contact an admin, current assignments, calendar of upcoming events, and a user info page.

### Tools Used In The App
